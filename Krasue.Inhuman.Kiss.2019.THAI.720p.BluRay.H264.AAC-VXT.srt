1
00:01:40,625 --> 00:01:42,741
It's getting dark.

2
00:01:43,958 --> 00:01:46,791
We're almost there.

3
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:45,789
Guys, have you heard
what people are talking?

4
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:55,625
There's a chest in this house that
holds nual's spirit.

5
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,707
She guards the forest
and refuses to go away.

6
00:03:00,375 --> 00:03:03,492
Whoever comes here at night...

7
00:03:04,917 --> 00:03:06,623
Won't be able to leave.

8
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:18,947
It's just a story!

9
00:03:18,958 --> 00:03:19,958
You chicken!

10
00:03:20,708 --> 00:03:22,869
Noi, you look so pale!

11
00:03:23,042 --> 00:03:25,829
If you're so scared you can leave.

12
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:27,994
How about you two?

13
00:03:33,958 --> 00:03:35,494
Black one out!

14
00:03:36,667 --> 00:03:38,248
It's ting!

15
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:40,208
Me again!

16
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:43,950
Poor you. Now close your eyes and count.

17
00:03:51,417 --> 00:03:57,333
One, two, three, four, five...

18
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:01,948
Noi, let's hide upstairs.
She won't find us.

19
00:04:02,958 --> 00:04:03,822
No.

20
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:04,833
Come on!

21
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:07,414
I'm coming to find youl!

22
00:04:31,292 --> 00:04:34,455
You don't hide in that corner.

23
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,786
I'm going to be in that room.

24
00:04:36,917 --> 00:04:40,284
If ting comes for me,
you sneak behind and tag her.

25
00:04:42,917 --> 00:04:44,327
Is it a good idea to split up?

26
00:04:47,417 --> 00:04:49,533
My dad gave me this protective amulet,

27
00:04:49,542 --> 00:04:51,498
you keep it.

28
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:54,833
Let's go.

29
00:05:58,542 --> 00:06:06,542
Krasue: Inhuman kiss

30
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,250
Sail

31
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:07,289
hi jerd, yam, toh!

32
00:08:08,417 --> 00:08:09,953
Leave the fish at my house.

33
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:16,037
Do you know when will the school reopen?

34
00:08:16,667 --> 00:08:19,329
We'll have to wait until
the war in Bangkok ends, sai.

35
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:21,915
But it's great not having to go to school!

36
00:08:22,417 --> 00:08:24,658
People are killed and hurt, jerd.

37
00:08:27,917 --> 00:08:31,330
Let's go to the field.
There won't be any patient tomorrow.

38
00:08:32,417 --> 00:08:33,577
Please.

39
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,239
Jerd!

40
00:08:54,292 --> 00:08:55,247
C'm on!

41
00:08:55,292 --> 00:08:56,657
Jerd, stop!

42
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:00,958
Aren't you bored?

43
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:17,581
Doctor metta!

44
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:20,740
Mon!

45
00:09:22,792 --> 00:09:24,532
No one's here.

46
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,117
They must've been called up in emergency.

47
00:09:29,417 --> 00:09:32,409
I heard Bangkok
got bombed pretty bad last night.

48
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,833
If it weren't for my dad,
I'd like to go there.

49
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:37,815
Aren't you afraid of getting killed?

50
00:09:38,292 --> 00:09:39,292
No.

51
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,911
I'd get to be a soldier,
to shoot at enemies.

52
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:43,493
Must be cool!

53
00:09:49,917 --> 00:09:51,657
Nurse! Stop!

54
00:09:53,167 --> 00:09:54,373
Go play with me now!

55
00:09:54,542 --> 00:09:55,542
Jerd!

56
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:06,326
No one's coming. Let's go outside.

57
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:09,790
No, someone might need help.

58
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:17,157
But if you don't go,
someone will get hurt for real.

59
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:20,125
Ouch!

60
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:23,741
Nurse, help me.

61
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:24,750
Jerd!

62
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:26,868
I'll cut your fingers off.

63
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:28,333
Please.

64
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:29,833
No.

65
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:36,615
Doctor! Are you here?

66
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:39,914
See?

67
00:10:41,667 --> 00:10:42,667
Coming!

68
00:10:50,417 --> 00:10:51,782
Just a little.

69
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:54,118
Sai...

70
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:58,872
I heard the krasue ate
your neighbour dang's hens.

71
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:00,744
I don't know.

72
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:04,287
Last night mai and his friends

73
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:06,115
went out to hunt rats.

74
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:07,911
They saw a floating light.

75
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:09,077
I knew it!

76
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:10,994
You have to take precautions.

77
00:11:12,292 --> 00:11:13,372
How?

78
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:18,540
Close all doors and windows at night.

79
00:11:18,542 --> 00:11:21,079
Don't hang your laundry outside.

80
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:23,495
The krasue likes to wipe its mouth with it.

81
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:30,367
If I really were krasue
you'd be dead by now.

82
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:33,780
If you were krasue I'd blow your head off.

83
00:11:33,792 --> 00:11:36,534
Tough talking, eh?

84
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:56,708
Sail

85
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:57,489
hmm?

86
00:11:57,875 --> 00:12:00,912
Don't you feel weird seeing
these things every day?

87
00:12:01,292 --> 00:12:02,292
Are you scared?

88
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:04,288
A bit.

89
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,664
I can't believe you grew up a scaredy cat.

90
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:12,289
But it's gross.

91
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:19,948
I kind of miss noi.

92
00:12:22,792 --> 00:12:24,703
Don't know how he's doing now.

93
00:12:33,667 --> 00:12:34,782
Sail

94
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:50,824
I'll be out on a patrol tonight.

95
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:54,698
Krasue, right?

96
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:57,198
Who told you that?

97
00:12:57,375 --> 00:13:00,913
Aunt kamlai. I treated her son today.

98
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:04,530
She said dang's hens were
eaten by the krasue.

99
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:09,245
But no one has seen it in a long time.

100
00:13:10,542 --> 00:13:11,952
I can't be certain...

101
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:13,748
You stay with grandma.

102
00:13:14,167 --> 00:13:16,954
Make sure to lock all doors and windows.

103
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:23,958
I'll get going.

104
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,250
Okay.

105
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:34,791
Come. Grandchild.

106
00:13:37,292 --> 00:13:38,281
Evening, grandma.

107
00:13:38,292 --> 00:13:39,407
Hi.

108
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:44,616
Jerd asked me to bring
plum mangoes for you.

109
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:46,750
Thanks.

110
00:13:47,292 --> 00:13:49,157
I stopped by at his house.

111
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:51,410
How are you, dum?

112
00:13:53,167 --> 00:13:54,657
You cutie.

113
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:58,412
Well, jerd is kind of cute too.

114
00:13:58,625 --> 00:14:01,207
Good-looking and rich...

115
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,020
Don't you like him even just a little?

116
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:05,707
He's head over heels in love with you.

117
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:09,207
I heard he's following
you around every day.

118
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:11,414
He just keeps me company.

119
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:15,744
Why are you shaking your legs?

120
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:16,330
Huh?

121
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:18,699
You're blushing?

122
00:14:19,917 --> 00:14:20,917
No.

123
00:14:24,542 --> 00:14:27,284
When you two finally do it,
let me be the first to know.

124
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:28,455
Ting!

125
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:29,750
What?

126
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:30,833
What're you saying!?

127
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:33,832
All right, I'm leaving.

128
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:35,323
You better eat the plum mango.

129
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:36,375
Just leave.

130
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:40,535
Make sure to eat some.

131
00:14:41,167 --> 00:14:42,202
Go home safely.

132
00:14:42,417 --> 00:14:43,497
See you.

133
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:30,618
Here, pandan water.

134
00:17:06,042 --> 00:17:07,042
Sai.

135
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:10,365
Let's go.

136
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:16,167
Sail

137
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:18,833
hmm?

138
00:17:20,542 --> 00:17:21,907
You spaced out.

139
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:31,375
Jerd.

140
00:17:32,667 --> 00:17:34,032
Come with me to the village.

141
00:17:58,917 --> 00:17:59,917
Wait.

142
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:11,786
We should turn back.

143
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:15,365
But we're nearly there.

144
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:18,535
It's dangerous.

145
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,958
If you're scared, you can go back first.

146
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,991
I'm not scared, I'm just worried.

147
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,500
Sail

148
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
noi!

149
00:19:40,667 --> 00:19:41,667
Sail

150
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,500
sail

151
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,500
Jerd!

152
00:19:57,833 --> 00:19:58,833
Noi!

153
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:37,368
We've come from salaya
where the krasue has wreaked havoc.

154
00:20:38,042 --> 00:20:39,122
In the beginning...

155
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:42,415
It ate all the chickens and ducks

156
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:44,990
until there was none left.

157
00:20:46,167 --> 00:20:49,284
Then the cows and buffaloes.

158
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:55,497
But the villagers were too slow
to take extreme measures.

159
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:58,163
So...

160
00:20:59,417 --> 00:21:01,874
It began to spread.

161
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:06,288
That was when pandemonium struck.

162
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:08,536
Spread? How?

163
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:15,951
Once the mother krasue
spits in the water...

164
00:21:18,417 --> 00:21:20,032
If a girl drinks it,

165
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:26,745
she'll turn into another krasue.

166
00:21:28,792 --> 00:21:30,123
If it's a man,

167
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:33,949
he'll be in terrible pain from the poison.

168
00:21:35,958 --> 00:21:38,540
When he can no longer endure it and dies,

169
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:43,038
the krasue will devour his guts.

170
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:51,663
The folks were scared and
already abandoned the village.

171
00:21:53,208 --> 00:21:55,620
Why should I believe any of this?

172
00:22:01,208 --> 00:22:02,368
Pai, plaew.

173
00:22:10,542 --> 00:22:14,535
These are some of the
krasue we had put down.

174
00:22:25,292 --> 00:22:28,364
We don't want anything
more than a place to stay.

175
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:31,832
In exchange, we'll hunt the demons for you.

176
00:22:33,125 --> 00:22:34,535
That sounds good, chief.

177
00:22:43,792 --> 00:22:46,033
Who told you there's a krasue here?

178
00:22:53,667 --> 00:22:56,784
I've brought a curry and boiled vegetables.

179
00:22:57,958 --> 00:22:59,789
I'll put it there.

180
00:23:04,167 --> 00:23:06,533
You must be hungry from the journey.

181
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,240
Thank you.

182
00:23:40,167 --> 00:23:41,657
Blankets and a mosquito net.

183
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:44,206
Hope it's good enough.

184
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:49,163
Of course, it was a lot worse in Bangkok.

185
00:23:53,208 --> 00:23:55,324
Why are you here alone?

186
00:23:55,958 --> 00:23:57,573
Where are your parents?

187
00:24:08,917 --> 00:24:11,158
Bangkok got bombed
terribly hard that night.

188
00:24:15,875 --> 00:24:17,706
My parents didn't make it.

189
00:24:23,667 --> 00:24:25,123
I'm sorry.

190
00:24:35,792 --> 00:24:37,908
And how are you doing?

191
00:24:39,792 --> 00:24:40,792
Fine.

192
00:24:41,208 --> 00:24:42,664
I come here every day.

193
00:24:43,333 --> 00:24:46,040
There's not much to do at home.

194
00:24:46,792 --> 00:24:49,499
So I'm here to assist
the doctors and nurses.

195
00:24:50,542 --> 00:24:53,579
They've just been called back to Bangkok.

196
00:24:54,333 --> 00:24:55,743
You want to become a nurse?

197
00:24:56,542 --> 00:24:58,749
I don't know, I guess.

198
00:24:59,875 --> 00:25:01,081
And you?

199
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:04,828
I'd just got into a medical school...

200
00:25:05,667 --> 00:25:09,285
When war broke out.

201
00:25:11,125 --> 00:25:12,285
When you graduate,

202
00:25:12,792 --> 00:25:14,532
you can come back to work here.

203
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:16,500
Of course.

204
00:25:17,583 --> 00:25:21,201
But I don't know what's
going to happen from now on.

205
00:25:27,625 --> 00:25:29,661
Have you ever had to deal
with critical cases?

206
00:25:31,083 --> 00:25:32,243
"Critical cases"?

207
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,664
Patients who're in really bad conditions.

208
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:46,041
Well, I have. Remember grandpa samran?

209
00:25:46,458 --> 00:25:49,700
Yes, the grumpy grandpa.

210
00:25:50,083 --> 00:25:51,664
He died.

211
00:25:53,708 --> 00:25:54,868
On this very bed.

212
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,993
Little noi of old wouldn't
be able to sleep here.

213
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:31,207
Soap, toothbrush and bathing cloth.

214
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:34,490
We're about the same size
so here's your shirt and pants.

215
00:26:34,542 --> 00:26:35,577
They should fit.

216
00:26:38,958 --> 00:26:39,913
Thanks.

217
00:26:39,917 --> 00:26:40,997
No problem.

218
00:26:42,875 --> 00:26:45,867
Ting, didn't you bring
anything for your friend?

219
00:26:46,667 --> 00:26:47,577
This lamp!

220
00:26:47,583 --> 00:26:49,198
Wow.

221
00:26:53,833 --> 00:26:57,121
Noi, is this hairstyle popular in the city?

222
00:26:59,417 --> 00:27:00,417
Jerd.

223
00:27:02,208 --> 00:27:05,245
Take sai home, I need to talk to noi.

224
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,367
Jerd, run along, I can go by myself.

225
00:27:36,542 --> 00:27:38,248
No, let me walk you home.

226
00:27:38,333 --> 00:27:39,618
I'm really fine.

227
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,492
It's late, let me come with you.

228
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:44,455
Go.

229
00:27:44,458 --> 00:27:45,458
No.

230
00:27:50,875 --> 00:27:53,992
Are you sure those men aren't bandits?

231
00:27:58,792 --> 00:28:00,657
Actually, I'm not.

232
00:28:00,917 --> 00:28:02,999
Then why did you bring them here?

233
00:28:07,833 --> 00:28:09,949
Because I have nowhere else to go.

234
00:28:11,042 --> 00:28:12,248
So you told them

235
00:28:13,167 --> 00:28:14,452
there's a krasue here?

236
00:29:57,958 --> 00:29:58,958
Sai.

237
00:30:04,708 --> 00:30:06,619
Krasue did that?

238
00:30:10,083 --> 00:30:11,823
Or maybe wild animals.

239
00:30:14,292 --> 00:30:15,327
Where's jerd?

240
00:30:18,458 --> 00:30:19,458
Krasue is fast,

241
00:30:19,917 --> 00:30:22,784
but you have to be faster.

242
00:30:25,875 --> 00:30:27,115
Slow down! Again!

243
00:30:53,167 --> 00:30:54,167
Slow down.

244
00:30:56,958 --> 00:30:57,958
Don't hurry.

245
00:31:00,167 --> 00:31:02,749
So you're going krasue-hunting with me now?

246
00:31:03,375 --> 00:31:04,535
I'm here to talk to jerd.

247
00:31:04,542 --> 00:31:06,373
Right.

248
00:31:07,792 --> 00:31:10,829
I forgot you two are friends.

249
00:31:11,875 --> 00:31:16,619
Come see me after you're finished with him.

250
00:31:20,292 --> 00:31:21,828
What're you doing here?

251
00:31:22,708 --> 00:31:24,118
Training, obviously.

252
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:27,208
You shouldn't,
we don't know what they're up to.

253
00:31:27,583 --> 00:31:29,039
Don't hang out with them.

254
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:32,947
I've been with them to several villages

255
00:31:33,292 --> 00:31:34,953
and I've never seen even one krasue.

256
00:31:36,792 --> 00:31:40,205
And we don't know
what really happened in salaya.

257
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,072
But you told them
there's a krasue in our village.

258
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:52,535
I did.

259
00:31:53,667 --> 00:31:54,998
But it was

260
00:31:56,333 --> 00:31:58,915
just an excuse for me to come back here.

261
00:32:01,917 --> 00:32:04,408
What if krasue had
nothing to do with any of this?

262
00:32:07,958 --> 00:32:09,368
So how did it all happen?

263
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:16,615
I don't know either.

264
00:32:18,708 --> 00:32:22,030
Knowing nothing won't save anyone.

265
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
I have to go.

266
00:32:57,083 --> 00:33:00,951
"Poking some muck frequently"

267
00:33:01,042 --> 00:33:04,114
"to create gas"

268
00:33:04,125 --> 00:33:07,913
"which can cause an explosion or fire"

269
00:33:28,667 --> 00:33:30,328
You don't believe in ghosts?

270
00:33:31,917 --> 00:33:33,999
No, I don't.

271
00:33:42,875 --> 00:33:45,662
Then what do you think it is?

272
00:33:51,583 --> 00:33:53,164
I still don't know.

273
00:33:54,792 --> 00:33:56,874
But I'm going to prove that

274
00:33:56,875 --> 00:33:59,207
krasue aren't real.

275
00:34:17,875 --> 00:34:18,875
Sail

276
00:34:30,167 --> 00:34:32,954
Don't forget to lock
your doors and windows.

277
00:34:34,458 --> 00:34:35,458
Yes.

278
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,742
Sang! Our child's gone!

279
00:37:17,583 --> 00:37:19,414
Help! Please help!

280
00:37:26,792 --> 00:37:27,622
Dum!

281
00:37:27,708 --> 00:37:30,120
Don't shoot! My son!

282
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:31,250
Calm down.

283
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:33,625
Dum.

284
00:37:34,792 --> 00:37:35,792
Dum.

285
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:46,957
Enough!

286
00:37:51,292 --> 00:37:52,292
Dum!

287
00:37:55,125 --> 00:37:56,125
Dum!

288
00:38:03,333 --> 00:38:04,333
Dum!

289
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:08,500
Dum, my son

290
00:38:08,833 --> 00:38:09,948
are you ok?

291
00:38:10,542 --> 00:38:11,542
Should be fine.

292
00:38:12,542 --> 00:38:13,657
Thank you.

293
00:38:53,667 --> 00:38:54,667
Sail

294
00:39:56,792 --> 00:39:57,952
Krasue.

295
00:41:41,917 --> 00:41:43,248
Thanks to tat,

296
00:41:43,958 --> 00:41:46,950
otherwise my son
would've been devoured by the demon.

297
00:41:48,125 --> 00:41:49,285
Poor dum.

298
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:54,038
My husband will join the
hunting party tonight.

299
00:41:54,875 --> 00:41:56,160
They'll sweep the whole village.

300
00:42:55,667 --> 00:42:56,667
Who're you?

301
00:42:58,417 --> 00:43:01,784
I'm noi, son of teacher sawai.

302
00:43:08,333 --> 00:43:10,415
Krasue don't hurt people.

303
00:43:11,125 --> 00:43:14,788
These demons have lived
alongside us for a long time.

304
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:18,037
They were once humans
who practiced black magic.

305
00:43:18,250 --> 00:43:22,869
Their spells backfired
and turned them into hellish ghouls.

306
00:43:24,125 --> 00:43:27,822
The female is called krasue.

307
00:43:28,958 --> 00:43:32,121
The male is called krahang.

308
00:43:33,667 --> 00:43:36,704
Usually people will hurry

309
00:43:37,375 --> 00:43:39,491
to find a hunter when they see a krasue.

310
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,286
Maybe this one isn't just any krasue.

311
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:48,955
Yes.

312
00:43:50,958 --> 00:43:52,744
She's someone I know.

313
00:44:03,625 --> 00:44:04,831
Listen...

314
00:44:06,542 --> 00:44:09,249
Believe what you see,

315
00:44:10,542 --> 00:44:15,957
but do what your heart tells you.

316
00:48:31,375 --> 00:48:32,455
Let's go.

317
00:48:57,958 --> 00:48:59,744
Jerd came by the health
centre this morning.

318
00:49:07,708 --> 00:49:09,664
We should act normal.

319
00:49:35,875 --> 00:49:37,331
Do you remember...

320
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:42,245
I used to be really scared of toads.

321
00:49:43,750 --> 00:49:45,035
It's ugly.

322
00:49:45,708 --> 00:49:46,788
Disgusting.

323
00:49:48,250 --> 00:49:50,161
No one wants to go near it.

324
00:49:53,083 --> 00:49:55,039
When I've become one myself...

325
00:49:57,958 --> 00:50:04,158
I realise that monsters
do have feelings, too.

326
00:51:40,333 --> 00:51:41,948
Aren't you tired of eating chicken?

327
00:51:42,667 --> 00:51:43,998
Stop it!

328
00:51:45,958 --> 00:51:48,119
I don't want you to think too much.

329
00:51:52,375 --> 00:51:54,991
No one has seen it for a month.

330
00:52:05,417 --> 00:52:08,079
"Krasue herb"

331
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:12,615
past Karma forces them

332
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:14,615
to drift around

333
00:52:14,625 --> 00:52:17,742
to repay their debts
through many lifetimes.

334
00:52:18,333 --> 00:52:22,906
They're condemned to hide like prey.

335
00:52:25,208 --> 00:52:28,780
Krasue would eat the plant
called krasue herb,

336
00:52:29,083 --> 00:52:33,497
to halt the bodily transformation.

337
00:52:35,708 --> 00:52:40,532
But I've never seen this plant myself.

338
00:52:52,125 --> 00:52:54,537
Let's check your body temperature.

339
00:52:56,792 --> 00:52:58,748
Hmm, looks like a fever.

340
00:52:59,583 --> 00:53:00,743
How long have you felt feverish?

341
00:53:00,750 --> 00:53:01,750
Two days.

342
00:53:01,958 --> 00:53:03,198
Sore throat?

343
00:53:03,792 --> 00:53:04,792
Yes.

344
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,662
Open your mouth please.

345
00:53:07,792 --> 00:53:10,249
Open your mouth.

346
00:53:10,708 --> 00:53:13,666
It doesn't look too bad. Runny nose?

347
00:53:13,833 --> 00:53:14,833
A bit.

348
00:53:14,917 --> 00:53:15,781
What colour is it?

349
00:53:15,875 --> 00:53:16,875
Green...

350
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,991
I see...

351
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:22,947
So I'll let our nurse sponge you.

352
00:53:23,750 --> 00:53:25,866
And I'll prescribe some pills to take home.

353
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:26,659
Yes.

354
00:53:26,833 --> 00:53:29,290
Take a nap and you'll be fine.

355
00:53:29,625 --> 00:53:30,625
Yes.

356
00:53:31,125 --> 00:53:32,410
Your turn, nurse!

357
00:53:36,958 --> 00:53:38,744
Is the water cold?

358
00:53:38,833 --> 00:53:39,413
Yes, it is.

359
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:40,500
Indeed!

360
00:53:46,333 --> 00:53:48,039
C'mon, nurse!

361
00:53:49,667 --> 00:53:51,077
You're so impatient, doctor.

362
00:53:53,125 --> 00:53:54,911
Gently, you'll hurt her.

363
00:53:55,667 --> 00:53:56,667
I'm gentle!

364
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:57,955
Does it hurt?

365
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,000
A little bit.

366
00:54:00,958 --> 00:54:01,958
Sai.

367
00:54:02,250 --> 00:54:03,490
I'll leave her to you.

368
00:54:05,417 --> 00:54:06,417
Jerd!

369
00:54:12,833 --> 00:54:13,833
Sai.

370
00:54:33,375 --> 00:54:34,455
Bael fruit juice.

371
00:55:00,292 --> 00:55:01,907
I'll be back.

372
00:55:01,958 --> 00:55:02,958
Yes.

373
00:55:10,208 --> 00:55:12,369
There'll be a full-scale hunt tonight.

374
00:55:12,542 --> 00:55:14,749
Secure your doors and windows.

375
00:55:15,875 --> 00:55:17,115
Be very careful.

376
00:55:18,250 --> 00:55:19,285
Right.

377
00:55:20,417 --> 00:55:21,623
I'll get going.

378
00:55:27,333 --> 00:55:27,913
Kaew!

379
00:55:27,958 --> 00:55:29,243
What's wrong!

380
00:55:29,625 --> 00:55:30,205
Kaew!

381
00:55:30,542 --> 00:55:31,542
Kaew!

382
00:55:31,708 --> 00:55:32,708
What's happen?

383
00:55:36,917 --> 00:55:38,873
Somebody help!

384
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:43,832
Help! Help us please!

385
00:56:00,083 --> 00:56:02,074
Tat! Tat!

386
00:56:30,833 --> 00:56:32,164
Come out, little girl.

387
00:56:32,875 --> 00:56:34,740
Come and eat this.

388
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,000
Pai, pleaw, now!

389
00:58:27,667 --> 00:58:28,827
Kaew

390
00:58:37,917 --> 00:58:39,748
Where had your daughter been?

391
00:58:40,625 --> 00:58:44,994
She was sick, I just took her
back from the health centre.

392
00:59:43,792 --> 00:59:45,783
Noi, what should I do?

393
00:59:48,917 --> 00:59:50,407
Kaew died because of me.

394
00:59:52,167 --> 00:59:55,239
One day the truth will come out.

395
00:59:56,875 --> 00:59:58,786
I don't want to go on like this.

396
01:00:04,625 --> 01:00:05,956
Gather yourself.

397
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:11,036
I'm trying to fix this.

398
01:00:25,250 --> 01:00:26,865
We have to go to the village.

399
01:00:29,917 --> 01:00:34,115
Whenever I'm in pain,
I have a vision of the village.

400
01:00:35,125 --> 01:00:37,491
In my mind.

401
01:00:39,375 --> 01:00:41,787
There must be something there.

402
01:00:44,167 --> 01:00:45,202
Noi...

403
01:00:48,917 --> 01:00:50,953
Come with me.

404
01:01:05,792 --> 01:01:09,956
We have to thank noi for bringing us here.

405
01:01:15,292 --> 01:01:20,787
But with this girl, we
have to tread carefully.

406
01:01:48,708 --> 01:01:50,949
Tat, I think this is a misunderstanding!

407
01:02:31,417 --> 01:02:32,417
Sai.

408
01:04:21,708 --> 01:04:22,823
So?

409
01:04:26,125 --> 01:04:28,366
It feels good.

410
01:04:32,208 --> 01:04:34,995
Great! We'll collect lots of them.

411
01:04:35,708 --> 01:04:37,414
I'll find a way to grow it

412
01:04:37,417 --> 01:04:39,703
so you won't transform again.

413
01:04:40,042 --> 01:04:44,160
See, there's finally a way out!

414
01:05:46,792 --> 01:05:48,453
But you'll be in great pain.

415
01:06:58,292 --> 01:06:59,292
Tat!

416
01:07:13,583 --> 01:07:14,698
Noi, you prick!

417
01:07:16,083 --> 01:07:17,083
Sai, run!

418
01:07:23,333 --> 01:07:25,995
All krasue are such sluts.

419
01:10:54,375 --> 01:10:55,490
Jerd!

420
01:11:12,958 --> 01:11:13,958
Jerd!

421
01:11:15,208 --> 01:11:16,208
Jerd!

422
01:11:16,292 --> 01:11:16,951
Jerd!

423
01:11:17,208 --> 01:11:18,208
Jerd!

424
01:12:10,875 --> 01:12:11,875
Sai.

425
01:12:13,500 --> 01:12:14,500
Sai.

426
01:12:16,792 --> 01:12:17,792
Sai.

427
01:12:18,958 --> 01:12:19,958
Sai.

428
01:13:14,792 --> 01:13:15,792
Sai.

429
01:13:17,625 --> 01:13:18,625
Sai.

430
01:13:20,250 --> 01:13:21,660
Grandma?

431
01:13:26,333 --> 01:13:27,698
Found him?

432
01:13:29,583 --> 01:13:30,823
Have you seen jerd?

433
01:13:36,292 --> 01:13:37,292
Jerd!

434
01:13:49,208 --> 01:13:50,208
Jerd!

435
01:14:08,083 --> 01:14:10,369
Chief, I couldn't find them anywhere.

436
01:14:23,792 --> 01:14:24,451
Jerd!

437
01:14:24,625 --> 01:14:25,625
Jerd!

438
01:14:26,458 --> 01:14:27,458
Jerd!

439
01:14:28,708 --> 01:14:29,708
Jerd!

440
01:14:45,417 --> 01:14:47,078
What the hell happened?

441
01:14:50,042 --> 01:14:53,864
We three chased it to
the old house in the village.

442
01:14:56,333 --> 01:14:57,743
Thought we'd cornered it.

443
01:15:03,167 --> 01:15:05,499
But this bitch isn't an ordinary krasue.

444
01:15:09,917 --> 01:15:11,248
It's vicious...

445
01:15:15,792 --> 01:15:18,534
And killed two of my men.

446
01:15:22,375 --> 01:15:24,161
Did you see her face?

447
01:15:24,958 --> 01:15:25,993
Who?

448
01:16:38,542 --> 01:16:40,248
Kill her!

449
01:16:43,417 --> 01:16:45,703
Sai, what are you doing?

450
01:16:45,792 --> 01:16:47,552
Did you see the bundle
I put on the cabinet?

451
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:49,000
Yes, I did.

452
01:16:51,083 --> 01:16:55,031
But where did I put it? I can't remember.

453
01:16:59,792 --> 01:17:00,872
She killed my child!

454
01:17:01,042 --> 01:17:02,202
She killed my child!

455
01:17:02,750 --> 01:17:03,364
Grandma!

456
01:17:03,583 --> 01:17:05,790
I'm trying to think!

457
01:17:05,792 --> 01:17:07,032
She killed my child!

458
01:17:07,208 --> 01:17:08,208
Stop!

459
01:17:08,625 --> 01:17:11,492
Right, it's in the laundry basket outside.

460
01:17:12,167 --> 01:17:14,954
What's the hurry?

461
01:17:15,167 --> 01:17:16,953
Kill her!

462
01:17:18,792 --> 01:17:19,792
Kill her!

463
01:17:29,500 --> 01:17:31,832
Monster! Come out!

464
01:17:32,208 --> 01:17:33,288
Show your face!

465
01:17:36,958 --> 01:17:38,164
Come out here!

466
01:17:48,042 --> 01:17:49,282
I'll call her myself.

467
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:53,411
If she's really a krasue,

468
01:17:54,750 --> 01:17:56,411
you can shoot her.

469
01:18:00,167 --> 01:18:01,167
Sail

470
01:18:05,083 --> 01:18:06,083
sail

471
01:18:07,208 --> 01:18:08,208
come out here!

472
01:18:14,542 --> 01:18:15,542
Sail

473
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:18,410
come out now!

474
01:18:22,292 --> 01:18:23,292
Sail

475
01:18:29,792 --> 01:18:32,408
Monster! Come out!

476
01:18:32,750 --> 01:18:35,492
Show your face!

477
01:18:39,708 --> 01:18:41,994
Pan, step aside.

478
01:18:43,583 --> 01:18:47,326
She's your child, but she's a demon!

479
01:18:49,208 --> 01:18:50,823
Let's storm the house!

480
01:18:57,917 --> 01:18:58,917
Dad.

481
01:19:04,375 --> 01:19:06,095
I've been calling you, where have you been?

482
01:19:06,417 --> 01:19:07,497
I was taking a bath.

483
01:19:11,125 --> 01:19:12,456
Look at her!

484
01:19:13,083 --> 01:19:14,198
Where's your krasue?

485
01:19:14,667 --> 01:19:15,667
Huh?

486
01:19:19,083 --> 01:19:24,908
Jerd, tell everyone what
you saw last night.

487
01:19:28,167 --> 01:19:31,034
Think of the poor girl who lost her life

488
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:36,197
because sai infected her
at the health centre.

489
01:19:42,042 --> 01:19:43,042
Jerd.

490
01:19:56,875 --> 01:20:00,413
Last night, tat and his gang
kidnapped me to their camp.

491
01:20:00,833 --> 01:20:02,539
They tried to rape me.

492
01:20:08,417 --> 01:20:10,783
Jerd rescued me and we ran away.

493
01:20:11,833 --> 01:20:13,949
Tat's men got mad and beat him up.

494
01:20:14,125 --> 01:20:15,125
Bullshit!

495
01:20:16,333 --> 01:20:17,809
What about the dead bodies at the camp?

496
01:20:17,833 --> 01:20:19,744
There's no proof that I did it.

497
01:20:19,875 --> 01:20:20,875
Sail

498
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,366
just admit you're a krasue.

499
01:20:25,042 --> 01:20:27,078
Jerd and I saw it with our own eyes.

500
01:20:38,542 --> 01:20:40,282
Tat and his men were trying to rape sai.

501
01:20:41,083 --> 01:20:42,083
Dad!

502
01:20:49,042 --> 01:20:50,407
Get out of my village.

503
01:20:51,917 --> 01:20:55,034
Love her, while you still can.

504
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:06,000
Folks!

505
01:21:06,458 --> 01:21:07,743
The show's over!

506
01:21:10,125 --> 01:21:12,366
I'll go after the krasue myself.

507
01:22:00,833 --> 01:22:03,666
You have the nerve to betray me!

508
01:23:36,667 --> 01:23:37,702
Can we do it next week?

509
01:23:37,833 --> 01:23:38,833
Yes.

510
01:23:39,958 --> 01:23:43,246
Gather all the villagers.

511
01:24:51,792 --> 01:24:55,114
Kill sai, and destroy her heart.

512
01:24:56,000 --> 01:25:00,039
Kill sai, and destroy her heart.

513
01:25:00,875 --> 01:25:03,867
Kill sai, and destroy her heart.

514
01:25:04,542 --> 01:25:11,618
Kill sai, and destroy her heart.

515
01:25:15,875 --> 01:25:17,740
Get out of my head!

516
01:26:17,833 --> 01:26:18,833
Noi!

517
01:26:25,333 --> 01:26:29,246
We're finished. There's no herb left.

518
01:26:56,042 --> 01:26:57,498
Let's run away to Bangkok.

519
01:27:08,208 --> 01:27:09,744
What about my dad?

520
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,707
Just worry about yourself!

521
01:27:13,708 --> 01:27:15,289
You're in danger!

522
01:27:15,500 --> 01:27:19,118
That bloodthirsty tat is
still snooping around.

523
01:27:33,250 --> 01:27:34,530
In Bangkok there must be someone

524
01:27:34,750 --> 01:27:36,911
who can help us.

525
01:27:41,625 --> 01:27:45,368
Meet me in the village
tomorrow after sunset.

526
01:27:46,792 --> 01:27:48,373
We have to make a run.

527
01:28:53,875 --> 01:28:54,875
Jerd.

528
01:29:12,542 --> 01:29:14,123
I've known all along

529
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:18,956
that you're a krasue.

530
01:29:26,458 --> 01:29:30,201
It's late, let me walk you home.

531
01:29:30,792 --> 01:29:31,792
No.

532
01:29:45,875 --> 01:29:49,618
That night at the cow pen,
I saw it for the first time.

533
01:30:13,583 --> 01:30:15,744
I joined the hunters

534
01:30:17,167 --> 01:30:19,624
so I could misdirect them.

535
01:30:31,250 --> 01:30:35,744
There'll be a full-scale hunt tonight.
Secure your doors.

536
01:30:45,958 --> 01:30:48,540
It hurts every time...

537
01:30:52,250 --> 01:30:55,663
I saw you with noi.

538
01:31:40,958 --> 01:31:43,825
Don't leave me.

539
01:31:46,375 --> 01:31:49,663
Please stay with me.

540
01:31:56,292 --> 01:31:58,374
Sai.

541
01:31:59,667 --> 01:32:02,454
Don't leave me.

542
01:32:14,625 --> 01:32:18,038
Please, sai...

543
01:33:23,083 --> 01:33:25,950
Sai, can I come in?

544
01:33:35,167 --> 01:33:36,282
Yes, dad.

545
01:33:50,417 --> 01:33:51,623
How are you?

546
01:33:53,958 --> 01:33:55,414
Still hurt?

547
01:34:06,083 --> 01:34:07,243
Dad...

548
01:34:08,792 --> 01:34:09,872
Hmm.

549
01:34:10,958 --> 01:34:13,950
One day if I'm no longer here...

550
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:17,956
Will you be all right?

551
01:34:20,542 --> 01:34:22,078
Why are you saying that?

552
01:34:29,375 --> 01:34:31,866
I won't let anyone hurt you.

553
01:34:33,125 --> 01:34:34,456
I promise.

554
01:35:01,875 --> 01:35:03,081
Venerable...

555
01:35:04,333 --> 01:35:06,324
I'm here to say goodbye.

556
01:35:09,083 --> 01:35:10,539
I also have something to ask you.

557
01:35:13,125 --> 01:35:14,615
About krasue and krahang,

558
01:35:15,083 --> 01:35:16,539
there's more to the story, isn't it?

559
01:35:19,208 --> 01:35:20,414
Have you seen her?

560
01:35:26,333 --> 01:35:27,618
Its history...

561
01:35:29,708 --> 01:35:31,414
Start like this...

562
01:35:31,875 --> 01:35:35,163
When the krasue who was
the wife of the first krahang

563
01:35:35,167 --> 01:35:36,873
fell in love with a human.

564
01:35:37,375 --> 01:35:39,491
She got pregnant

565
01:35:40,750 --> 01:35:43,207
and they ran away together.

566
01:35:44,250 --> 01:35:47,617
But krahang found them.

567
01:35:48,042 --> 01:35:49,248
He killed the man.

568
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:57,246
Then he killed his wife
and ripped her heart out

569
01:35:57,625 --> 01:36:00,537
to avenge his own heartbreak.

570
01:36:01,667 --> 01:36:04,079
His wrath was passed down
through generations.

571
01:36:05,292 --> 01:36:06,828
Since then,

572
01:36:07,417 --> 01:36:10,705
a krahang has to destroy
every krasue's heart.

573
01:36:35,625 --> 01:36:36,625
Sai.

574
01:36:38,292 --> 01:36:39,292
Sai.

575
01:37:09,750 --> 01:37:11,741
So they can't spread another rumour.

576
01:37:33,500 --> 01:37:34,500
Sai.

577
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:37,000
Hi.

578
01:37:37,125 --> 01:37:38,706
Good evening, chief.

579
01:37:40,083 --> 01:37:41,869
What're they showing?

580
01:37:43,583 --> 01:37:46,541
Have you seen jerd lately?

581
01:38:10,333 --> 01:38:14,906
Poor jerd, as selfless as a Saint.

582
01:38:15,958 --> 01:38:20,952
Trying to protect the girl
who hasn't even looked at you.

583
01:38:24,958 --> 01:38:26,118
Stop!

584
01:38:28,750 --> 01:38:30,957
Love is poison.

585
01:38:32,292 --> 01:38:37,616
It turns you into a fool,
an irredeemable fool!

586
01:38:38,333 --> 01:38:39,698
Go away!

587
01:38:40,167 --> 01:38:42,123
Leave me alone!

588
01:38:45,958 --> 01:38:50,782
Do you think sai's going
to keep her promise?

589
01:38:52,250 --> 01:38:55,617
She's running away with noi to Bangkok!

590
01:38:56,292 --> 01:38:57,498
She's going to leave you.

591
01:38:58,708 --> 01:38:59,868
She's leaving you behind!

592
01:38:59,958 --> 01:39:03,496
You're such a fool. A fool! A fool!

593
01:39:09,375 --> 01:39:10,375
Sail

594
01:39:10,708 --> 01:39:11,708
what's wrong?

595
01:39:15,292 --> 01:39:16,292
Sai...

596
01:39:16,625 --> 01:39:17,625
Sai...

597
01:39:21,167 --> 01:39:22,167
Sai...

598
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:24,206
What's wrong?

599
01:39:24,542 --> 01:39:25,542
Sai...

600
01:39:27,792 --> 01:39:28,451
Sai...

601
01:39:28,792 --> 01:39:29,372
Sai...

602
01:39:29,500 --> 01:39:30,500
Sai...

603
01:39:30,958 --> 01:39:31,958
Sai...

604
01:39:32,042 --> 01:39:33,042
Sai...

605
01:40:07,167 --> 01:40:11,240
Kill sai! Rip her heart out!

606
01:40:23,208 --> 01:40:24,368
Burn her body!

607
01:41:14,458 --> 01:41:15,618
Stop!

608
01:41:32,375 --> 01:41:33,375
Jerd...

609
01:41:48,125 --> 01:41:49,205
That's sai.

610
01:41:50,833 --> 01:41:52,369
Don't hurt her.

611
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:55,000
I beg you.

612
01:42:34,792 --> 01:42:35,792
Get out!

613
01:42:35,958 --> 01:42:36,958
Come on!

614
01:42:37,125 --> 01:42:37,784
Come on!

615
01:42:38,042 --> 01:42:39,498
I said stop!

616
01:42:39,958 --> 01:42:40,868
Stop!

617
01:42:40,958 --> 01:42:41,958
Stop it!

618
01:44:29,083 --> 01:44:30,083
Noi...

619
01:44:32,292 --> 01:44:33,577
Take care of sai.

620
01:44:34,917 --> 01:44:35,917
Sai...

621
01:44:36,375 --> 01:44:37,375
Sai...

622
01:44:51,750 --> 01:44:53,115
Sai, let's go!

623
01:45:09,917 --> 01:45:13,284
Noi, why are you protecting her?

624
01:45:14,708 --> 01:45:17,996
She's a whore, nothing but a whore!

625
01:45:21,417 --> 01:45:23,829
You think she's going to love you forever?

626
01:45:23,917 --> 01:45:24,531
You really think so?

627
01:45:24,542 --> 01:45:25,577
Shut up!

628
01:46:28,250 --> 01:46:30,332
Take that as my apology, nual...

629
01:46:34,250 --> 01:46:35,865
Someone saw it last night.

630
01:46:36,625 --> 01:46:38,616
Reng's internal organs are gone.

631
01:46:39,500 --> 01:46:42,537
Who do you think it is?

632
01:46:52,333 --> 01:46:53,493
Nual...

633
01:48:12,750 --> 01:48:13,910
Noi.

634
01:48:14,208 --> 01:48:18,156
Go through the village
and you'll find a river.

635
01:48:18,958 --> 01:48:20,869
On the other side is Bangkok.

636
01:48:21,625 --> 01:48:22,831
Hurry!

637
01:49:48,292 --> 01:49:49,372
Sail

638
01:49:50,750 --> 01:49:51,956
sail

639
01:50:03,750 --> 01:50:04,990
We're almost there.

640
01:50:10,667 --> 01:50:13,955
Just across the river and
we will go to Bangkok soon.

641
01:50:14,250 --> 01:50:15,956
Hang in there.

642
01:50:17,083 --> 01:50:18,948
I'll find a way to treat you.

643
01:50:19,500 --> 01:50:22,913
You'll be all right. I'll cure you.

644
01:50:23,667 --> 01:50:25,828
Hang in there, just a little more.

645
01:50:26,458 --> 01:50:27,823
Just a little more.

646
01:50:33,042 --> 01:50:34,623
Just a little more.

647
01:50:35,333 --> 01:50:37,415
Hang in there, just a little more.

648
01:50:42,667 --> 01:50:43,667
You'll be all right.

649
01:50:45,500 --> 01:50:46,865
You'll be all right.

650
01:51:11,208 --> 01:51:14,371
Everything's going to be all right.

651
01:51:25,958 --> 01:51:29,405
You'll be fine, I'll treat you myself.

652
01:53:21,125 --> 01:53:22,831
I'm sorry.

653
01:53:24,958 --> 01:53:27,916
I'm sorry I can't keep my promise...

654
01:57:06,833 --> 01:57:09,996
When the war's over,
let's go to Bangkok together.

655
01:57:10,333 --> 01:57:11,743
I'll show you around.

656
01:57:13,167 --> 01:57:14,953
Great, I want to go.

657
01:57:18,167 --> 01:57:19,373
Promise?

658
01:57:22,542 --> 01:57:23,782
Promise.
